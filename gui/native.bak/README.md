# Rust Crates

This folder contains Rust crates. Entry point of the Rust logic is the `hub` library crate. These crates are integrated and compiled into the Flutter app by the [Rinf](https://rinf.cunarist.com) framework.

- Do NOT change the name of the `hub` crate. Compilation presets expect the entry library crate to be located at `./native/hub`.
- You CAN name crates other than `hub` as you want.
